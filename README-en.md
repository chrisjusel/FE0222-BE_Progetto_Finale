## Overview
This application was built with Spring and exposes REST methods that allow the main data read and write operations.
- There is the persistence layer on Database and the JPA framework is used, specifically through the Hybernate ORM,
to abstract the business logic written in Java from the operations to be performed on whatever underlying DBMS is desired.
- All the methods that the API exposes are documented with Open-Api and Swagger.
- There is also an authentication system through JWT tokens.
- An exception handling system was adopted within the project, and the code was tested with the JUnit testing framework.
- Each time the application is started, by default, all test data are reloaded and go to populate the database by reading from csv files. 
This behavior can be changed in the application.properties.
- Paging has been implemented for read operations.
- The application has been released on Heroku.
